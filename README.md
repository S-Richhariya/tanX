**Note:** As mentioned in the task my task was to write a Python program that reads the data from the CSV file and performs
the following tasks:
● Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.
● Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.
● Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the
dataset.
● Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

But I have also done the test case checking of the code with **test_order_analysis.py'** file for unit testing.
and also tried to visualize the output data through libraries available in python like matplotlib and seaborn 
with **order_visualization.py**

# Online Store Order Analysis and Visualization

# Overview

This project provides an analysis and visualization of customer orders from an online store. The data is contained in a CSV file named `orders.csv` and includes information about 
order IDs, customer IDs, order dates, product IDs, product names, product prices, and quantities. The project consists of three main scripts:

1. `order_analysis.py`: This script performs data loading, analysis, and calculation of total revenue by month, product, and customer. It also identifies the top customers by revenue.

2. `order_visualization.py`: This script visualizes the results of the analysis, including total revenue by month, product, and the top customers by revenue.

3. `test_order_analysis.py`: This script contains unit tests for validating the functionality and correctness of the analysis functions.

## Project Structure

 `orders.csv`: The dataset containing customer order information.
 `order_analysis.py`: Script for data analysis.
 `order_visualization.py`: Script for data visualization.
 `test_order_analysis.py`: Script for testing the analysis functions.
 `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## Dependencies

To run this project, we will need to have the following Python packages installed:

 `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
 `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualization.
 `seaborn`: For enhanced visualization.
 `unittest`: For testing (comes with the standard Python library).

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use

1. **Data Analysis (`order_analysis.py`):**
   - The script `order_analysis.py` performs various data analysis tasks:
     - Computes total revenue by month.
     - Computes total revenue by product.
     - Computes total revenue by customer.
     - Identifies the top customers by revenue.


2. **Data Visualization (`order_visualization.py`):**
   - The script `order_visualization.py` visualizes the analysis results:
     - Visualizes total revenue by month.
     - Visualizes total revenue by product.
     - Visualizes the top customers by revenue.


3. **Testing (`test_order_analysis.py`):**
   - The script `test_order_analysis.py` contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the analysis functions.
   - These tests ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results provided by the analysis functions.

   To run the tests, use the following command:

   ```
   python -m unittest test_order_analysis.py
   ```

   The tests will provide output indicating whether each test passed or failed, ensuring that the functions work as expected.

## Implementation Details

### `order_analysis.py`

- **Functions:**
  - `load_data(file_path)`: Loads the data from the CSV file.
  - `total_revenue_by_month(df)`: Calculates the total revenue by month.
  - `total_revenue_by_product(df)`: Calculates the total revenue by product.
  - `total_revenue_by_customer(df)`: Calculates the total revenue by customer.
  - `top_customers_by_revenue(df, top_n=10)`: Identifies the top N customers by revenue.

### `order_visualization.py`

- **Functions:**
  - `visualize_revenue_by_month(df)`: Plots the total revenue by month.
  - `visualize_revenue_by_product(df)`: Plots the total revenue by product.
  - `visualize_top_customers(df, top_n=10)`: Plots the top N customers by revenue.

### `test_order_analysis.py`

- **Tests:**
  - Tests for each analysis function to ensure they return the correct results.
  - Example tests include checking the correctness of total revenue calculations by month, product, and customer, and verifying the identification of top customers by revenue.

## Data File

- `orders.csv`: The CSV file should contain the following columns:
  - `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order.
  - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - `order_date`: Date when the order was placed.
  - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
  - `product_name`: Name of the product.
  - `product_price`: Price of the product.
  - `quantity`: Quantity of the product ordered.
